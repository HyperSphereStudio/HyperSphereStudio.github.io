    I am currently studying Engineering Physics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Unversity. 
    Over the COVID pandemic I decided to learn more about Computer Science and became proffecient with over 9 programming 
    languages (C++, Julia etc) and over many topics (Client-Server Systems, Numerical Computation & Simulation, Program Language Design etc).
