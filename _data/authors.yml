    I am currently studying Engineering Physics (Bachelors & Accelerated Masters) at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Unversity. 
    As an undergraduate studying physics, I have developed a strong interest in three main areas: quantum computing, fusion energy, and space.
    
    Over the COVID pandemic I decided to learn more about Computer Science. 
    I have since become very prociefient in C#, Java, Python, Julia, C++, and C, and have some exposure to other programming languages as well (Matlab etc.) 
    and over many topics (Client-Server Systems, Numerical Computation, Simulation & Optimization, Embedded Systems, Program Language Design etc).
